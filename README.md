# Analytics Portfolio

Hello again. My name is Kevin Rodriguez and in this repository you will find some of my projects/presentations that I have done. Thank you for taking the time to view my work. 

All my work is presented either in iPython notebooks or Rnotebooks/R markdown files.

  * [Bonferroni Corrections](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Presentations/Kevin%20Rodriguez%20Math%20699%20Presentation.pdf): Presented to class when and how to use Bonferroni Correction/Adjustment. The correction is based on the idea if an experimenter is testing n independent or dependent hypotheses, than one way of maintaining or controlling the familywise error rate is to test each individual hypothesis at a statistical significance level of 1/n times.
