# Analytics Portfolio

Hello again. My name is Kevin Rodriguez and in this repository you will find some of my projects/presentations that I have done. Thank you for taking the time to view my work. 

All my work is presented either in iPython notebooks or Rnotebooks/R markdown files.

## Contents

* Presentations

  * [Bonferroni Corrections](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Presentations/Kevin%20Rodriguez%20Math%20699%20Presentation.pdf): Presented to class when and how to use Bonferroni Correction/Adjustment. The correction is based on the idea if an experimenter is testing n independent or dependent hypotheses, than one way of maintaining or controlling the familywise error rate is to test each individual hypothesis at a statistical significance level of 1/n times.

  * [Bootstrapping and Resampling](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Presentations/Bootrapping%20Slides.pdf): Presented to class what Bootstrapping is and when to apply it. Bootstrapping is a statistical technique that falls under resampling. Just like standard ways to find confidence intervals, we can use Bootstrapping to estimate a population parameter.

* Projects

	* [Determining Income](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Determining%20Income.pdf): Our goal was to determine whether a person is able to make $50,000 or more based on 14
variables. We used machine learning algorithms such as, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest method, and stepwise selection to compare the variables, as well as doing an exploratory analysis of the data.
	
	* [Acey Duecy](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Acey_Duecy.ipynb): Acey Duecy is a game that I created for a project. I used classes to create the cards and deck The instructions for game found in jupyter notebook. **(You can copy/paste the code in python file to run game)**

* Python Scripts

	* [Euler's Method](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Scripts/Euler's%20Method.ipynb): Euler's method is a numerical method to solve first order differential equation with a given initial value. Used packages such as **numpy**,**sympy**, and **matplotlib** for visualizations.
	
	* [RK4](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Scripts/RK4.ipynb): Just like Euler's Method, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta,RK4 is a method to approximate a first order differential equation. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method requires four evaluations of the righthand side per step h. 
	
	* [Taylor Series/Expansion](https://github.com/kdavidr94/analytics_portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Scripts/taylor.ipynb): A Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point.
